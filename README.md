# Battle Simulator Game

## Project Summary

**What does this application do?**

This application simulates a game where players design simple characters that can be pitted against each other in combat,
or sent to fight a preset boss. Players receive a limited amount of points that can be allocated to stats like *HP*,
*ATK*, and *DEF*. They can also give their characters attributes like *name* and *battle quote*. Stats and
attributes can be viewed by players freely from the starting menu, and players also have the option of deleting
an existing character. The actual combat consists of an RPG like system where the two combatants take turns attacking each 
other. Unlike most RPGs the battle sequence is automatic and players cannot choose actions per turn, the opponents simply
deal their attack on their turn in a back and forth fashion until one of them runs out of *HP* and is defeated.


**Who will use it?**

This application is designed to entertain people who enjoy playing games and creating their own characters, and want a
bit of a challenge (this is accomplished by having the player figure out what combination of stats will be necessary to
defeat the preset boss).


**Why did I choose this project?**

I myself enjoy playing games and entertain the idea of designing my own games, so I chose this
project in order to practice skills such as character creation and designing a combat system from scratch on Java.
